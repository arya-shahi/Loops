# Loops

## AIM - 
To use loops for given conditions

## Software Used - 
VS Code
## Theory
In programming, loops are fundamental constructs that enable developers to control the flow of execution within a program. They allow for the creation of dynamic and responsive software that can adapt to varying conditions and perform repeated tasks efficiently. Loops, such as for, while, and do-while, allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly until a specified condition is met. 

**ALGORITHM**

 1)
Start a loop with a variable i initialized to 0.
Continue the loop while i is less than or equal to 10.
If i is 3 or 5, skip the current iteration 
Otherwise, print the value of i.
After processing, increment the value of i by 1.
Repeat steps 2-4 until the loop condition (i <= 10) is no longer true.
Exit the loop and terminate the program.

 2)
Begin execution of the program.
Set a variable i to 1.
Check if i is less than or equal to 5.
If true, proceed with the loop body; if false, exit the loop.
Increase the value of i by 1.
Repeat steps 3 to 5 until i exceeds 5.
 After exiting the loop, complete the program.

 3)
Set i to 1.
Set j to 5.
Ensure j is greater than or equal to i.
Output an asterisk followed by a space.
Decrement j.
After the inner loop ends, print a newline to start the next row.
End the program after completing all rows.

4)
Initialize k to n.
Print * if the column index is greater than or equal to k.
Print a space otherwise.
After printing all columns in a row, decrease k by 1.
Move to the next line after completing a row.

**Conclusion**

In this experiment we learned using loops in programs.
