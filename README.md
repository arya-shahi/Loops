# Loops

## AIM - 
To use loops for given conditions

## Software Used - 
VS Code
## Theory
In programming, loops are fundamental constructs that enable developers to control the flow of execution within a program. They allow for the creation of dynamic and responsive software that can adapt to varying conditions and perform repeated tasks efficiently. Loops, such as for, while, and do-while, allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly until a specified condition is met. 

**ALGORITHM**

### Algorithm 1:
   - Start a loop with a variable `i` initialized to 0.
   - Continue the loop while `i` is less than or equal to 10.
   - **If `i` is 3 or 5**:
     - Skip the current iteration.
   - **Otherwise**:
     - Print the value of `i`.
   - After processing, increment the value of `i` by 1.
   - Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the loop condition (`i <= 10`) is no longer true.
   - Exit the loop and terminate the program.

### Algorithm 2:
   - Start the program.
   - Set a variable `i` to 1.
   - Check if `i` is less than or equal to 5.
   - If true, print "SIT" followed by a newline.
   - Increase the value of `i` by 1.
   - Repeat steps 3 to 5 until `i` exceeds 5.
   - After exiting the loop, complete the program.

### Algorithm 3: 

   - Set `i` to 1.
   - Set `j` to 5.
   - Ensure `j` is greater than or equal to `i`.
   - **For Each Column `j`**:
     - **If `j` is Greater Than or Equal to `k`**:
       - Print an asterisk (`*`) followed by a space.
     - **Else**:
       - Print a space.
   - After processing all columns in a row, move to the next line.
   - Decrease `k` by 1 for the next row.
   - Repeat steps 2 to 4 until all rows are processed.
   - After exiting the loop, complete the program.

**Conclusion**

In this experiment we learned using loops in programs.
